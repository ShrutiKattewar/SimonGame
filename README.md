# Get ready to watch, remember, repeat!
The Simon game is the exciting game of colours and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of colours by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with colour and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. Keep track of your score as you challenge friends or try to beat your own high score.
